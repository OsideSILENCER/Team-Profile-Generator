# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description
 This is a Team profile Generator server.

I was motivated by my instructor John eligntened insistence to build this server.

I built this project utilizing html, multiple javascript pages. pck json and even gitignore.

I had issues connecting the different variables and pages at at first.

Resoloving the issues solved the issue of getting the project to work

I learned how to create place holders to enter in incoming and existing employee data
